About The App?
------
This is an online application that uses Creation-of-Individualized-Questions and Dividni to create personalized questions. The program allows teachers to create personalized questions, Question banks, and more. Question banks can be imported into learning management systems such as Canvas and Moodle, digital assessment platforms such as Inspera, other QTI-compatible educational applications, and in pdf format of exam papers.

What is Dividni?
------
Dividni helps to create individualized assessments. Individualization encourages students to engage in concept-oriented discussions rather than mere exchange of answers. It also enables an instructor to repeat an assessment activity with a different set of questions, thereby reinforcing student learning. In addition, individualization renders any blind copying in an assessment ineffective. Consequently, it is seen as a positive approach to mitigating collusion and plagiarism.

Acknowledgements
------
I would like to express our gratitude to all those who helped us during the completing of this project.  
  
My deepest gratitude goes first to my mentors (Sathiamoorthy Manoharan and Xinfeng Ye). The team of teachers provided me with a platform to build the app and provided feedback and help with my needs. At the same time, it plays an important role in the project design and gives us a lot of guiding opinions and useful suggestions. 
  
I'm also very grateful to the people who used my app and filled out the survey. It was because of the bugs they found and the constructive comments they provided that the project ended successfully.
